# Blink LED

This is a simple Arduino project that makes the built-in LED on pin 13 blink on and off.

## Code

- `blink.ino` â€” Arduino sketch that toggles the LED every 1 second.

## How to use

Connect the LED to pin 13 (or use the built-in LED on Arduino Uno).  
Upload the sketch to your Arduino board.  
The LED will turn on for 1 second, then off for 1 second, repeatedly.
