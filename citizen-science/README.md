# Citizen Science Projects (Ukraine-based)

This folder contains my citizen-science-inspired projects related to marine and freshwater observation, using basic sensors and open data.  
Although I currently live far from the ocean, I use rivers, lakes, and public marine datasets to simulate and analyze real-world scenarios.

### 🔧 Goals:
- Practice data collection using Arduino and sensors
- Simulate oceanographic measurements
- Analyze environmental conditions (e.g. temperature, water clarity, salinity)
- Prepare for future real expeditions and internships

### 🔍 Subfolders:
- `local_logs/` — observations from local rivers or lakes
- `open-data/` — experiments with real ocean data (NOAA, EMODnet, etc.)
- `simulations/` — Arduino-based simulated missions
